# Inventory_Management_System

This project is a database-driven *Garment Inventory Management System* designed to streamline the tracking of garments, orders, sales, and supplier relationships. The system provides a structured and efficient way to manage stock levels, track supplier transactions, and monitor customer orders in real time.  

Using an *Entity-Relationship (ER) model, the system ensures data integrity, minimizes redundancy, and optimizes performance. The **garments module* stores product details such as category, size, color, quantity, and pricing, while the *orders and sales modules* enable businesses to manage customer purchases, track transactions, and calculate profitability. The *suppliers module* helps maintain supplier details, ratings, and purchase histories, ensuring smooth procurement operations.  

Additionally, the system features a *user management module* with role-based access control, allowing different levels of user permissions. The *activity log* records user actions for auditing and security purposes. The *settings module* allows customization of key system parameters to adapt to business needs.  

With *real-time updates, structured data management, and detailed reporting capabilities*, this system enhances operational efficiency, facilitates informed decision-making, and optimizes inventory workflows for businesses in the garment industry.
